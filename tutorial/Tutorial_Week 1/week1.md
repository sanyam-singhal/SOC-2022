# Deep RL SoC-2022

## Week 1

This week, we will start with the basics of reinforcement learning.

For reinforcement learning, we will initially do the "non-deep learning" version i.e. the core reinforcement learning models and algorithms. Then, to extend our capabilities to handle more complex problems, we will incorporate deep learning (Deep Reinforcement Learning= Deep Learning + Reinforcement Learning).

In reinforcement learning, the essential idea is to have an "actor", which takes an action and a "critic", who presents a reward signal (could be a punishing signal as well).

Go through the following material:

1. Basic Material:

1a. [Multi-Armed Bandits](https://medium.com/opex-analytics/multi-armed-bandits-101-6f4ac62b6bd6)

1b. [Markov Decision Process](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-markov-decision-process-44c533ebf8da)

1c. [Dynamic Programming](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-solving-mdps-using-dynamic-programming-part-3-b53d32341540)

1d. [Monte Carlo Methods](https://towardsdatascience.com/monte-carlo-methods-9b289f030c2e)

1e. [Temporal Difference Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/temporal-difference-learning-47b4a7205ca8) 

2. My notes (atleast understand the algorithms): Go through them in the following sequence: bandit->mdp->dynamic_prog->monte_carlo->td_learning

3. [Video Lectures (optional)](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/teaching/old/cs747-a2021/index.html) These are for reference.
