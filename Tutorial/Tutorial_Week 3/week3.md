# Stock Market and Technical Analysis

## This week's study reference:

This week we cover the basics of stock market and technical analysis that help us understand the finance aspect of our project.

The best source for beginners is the Varisty blog by Zerodha.
 
Go through the following:
1. [The stock market basics](https://zerodha.com/varsity/module/introduction-to-stock-markets/). Note that the webpage also has video explanations for some sections.

2. [Technical Analysis](https://zerodha.com/varsity/module/technical-analysis/). Need not cover the entire module, understanding of all sections till moving averages should suffice.
